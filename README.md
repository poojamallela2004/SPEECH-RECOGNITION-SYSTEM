The Speech Recognition System is an intelligent application designed to convert human speech from short audio clips into written text. This system leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and pre-trained deep learning models to understand and transcribe audio efficiently and accurately. The project is built using Python and popular open-source libraries such as SpeechRecognition, Wav2Vec2.0, Transformers, and Librosa.

The goal of the system is to enable automatic speech-to-text conversion, which has wide-ranging applications in voice assistants, transcription tools, accessibility software, and more. The system supports two primary approaches to speech recognition: one using the speech_recognition library with Google’s Web Speech API

SpeechRecognition Library
This approach is suitable for beginners and uses the Python library speech_recognition, which provides a simple API to work with various speech engines. In this method, the user provides a .wav audio file, which is loaded and passed to the recognizer. The system then uses Google's free speech-to-text API to transcribe the audio. This is an easy-to-use method for basic transcription needs, requiring minimal setup. The library handles noise reduction, audio segmentation, and speech decoding internally.

However, this method requires an active internet connection and depends on Google’s servers. It may also face limitations in terms of audio length, accuracy in noisy environments, and privacy concerns since audio is sent to an external server for processing.
